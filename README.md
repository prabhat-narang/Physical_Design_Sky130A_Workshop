## Introduction to OpenLANE


### Directory Structure

### Design Preparation Step

### Reviewing files
After successfull execution of design preparation step, a 'runs' folder appears in the project directory. Inside 'runs', a folder with date of execution as name is created. In this folder, all the folders except the 'temp' folder is empty after the previous step. The following files/folders are present in this folder:
- tmp: It has merged.lef file. It is made by merging .tlef files and .lef files. It has layers and via information as well as cell level information. This folder has temporary files as the name suggests.
- results: Resulting outputs are stored here after each stage (Synthesis, Placement, Floorplan, etc)
- reports: Repoorts generated at each stage is stored here.
- logs: Contains logs for each stage.
- config.tcl: This file shows all default parameters taken by run. Also contains location of tlef, lef, lib and other important files. The parameters in this file are updated on the go. So after a stage, if we decide to change a parameter of that step, the changes will be displayed in this file, and can be used for debugging.
- cmds.log: Contains log of commands that are executed.

### Running Synthesis Step
To run the sythesis step, which runs Yosys and ABC, run command `run_synthesis`. This step usually take 5-6 minutes to execute.
